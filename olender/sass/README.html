<p>Sass makes CSS fun again. Sass is an extension of CSS3, adding nested rules,
variables, mixins, selector inheritance, and more. It’s translated to well-
formatted, standard CSS using the command line tool or a web-framework plugin.</p>
<p>Sass has two syntaxes. The new main syntax (as of Sass 3) is known as “SCSS”
(for “Sassy CSS”), and is a superset of CSS3’s syntax. This means that every
valid CSS3 stylesheet is valid SCSS as well. SCSS files use the extension .scss.</p>
<p>The second, older syntax is known as the indented syntax (or just “Sass”).
Inspired by Haml’s terseness, it’s intended for people who prefer conciseness
over similarity to CSS. Instead of brackets and semicolons, it uses the
indentation of lines to specify blocks. Although no longer the primary syntax,
the indented syntax will continue to be supported. Files in the indented syntax
use the extension .sass.</p>
<p>Please refer to the <a href="http://sass-lang.com/docs.html">Sass documentation</a> for
further information about the syntax.</p>
<h2 id="introduction-to-compass-http-compass-style-org-">Introduction to <a href="http://compass-style.org/">Compass</a></h2>
<p>Compass is an open-source CSS Authoring Framework.</p>
<p>Please refer to the <a href="http://compass-style.org/reference">Compass documentation</a>
for further information on how to leverage the powerful Compass framework.</p>
<h2 id="compass-extensions">Compass extensions</h2>
<p>There are many extensions available for Compass. You can install and use as many
of them together or just a single one depending on your use-case. Good examples
for useful Compass extensions are &quot;susy&quot; (a responsive grid framework
[<a href="http://susy.oddbird.net/">http://susy.oddbird.net/</a>]) or &quot;compass-rgbapng&quot; (a rgba() .png file generator)
but there are many more.</p>
<h2 id="setting-up-and-using-sass-and-compass">Setting up and using Sass and Compass</h2>
<p>Compass runs on any computer that has
<a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads">ruby</a> installed.</p>
<p>Once you got ruby installed you can easily install the required gems from the
command line:</p>
<pre><code>$ gem update --system
$ gem install compass
</code></pre><p>Any additional library can be installed in the same way:</p>
<pre><code>$ gem install compass-rgbapng
$ gem install susy
</code></pre><p>Once you have set up your environment you can navigate to the folder that holds
your config.rb file.</p>
<p>The config.rb file is the configuration file that helps Sass and Compass to
understand your environment. For example, it defines which folder your .scss
or .sass files are stored in or where the generated .css files should be output
to.</p>
<p>Executing the following command will constantly watch for any change in your
.scss files and re-compile them into .css:</p>
<pre><code>$ compass watch
</code></pre><p>You can also clear and recompile your .css manually:</p>
<pre><code>$ compass clean
$ compass compile
</code></pre><h2 id="barebones-sass-structure">Barebones Sass Structure</h2>
<p>The barebones CSS structure provided in this starterkit uses many of the ideas
discussed in Jonathan <a href="http://smacss.com">Snook&#39;s SMACSS</a> and is intended to
provide a starting point for building modular, scalable CSS using Sass and
Drupal.</p>
<p>Multiple Sass partials are used to help organise the styles, these are combined
by including them in styles.scss which is compiled into styles.css in the css/
directory.</p>
<p>All styles are included in order of specificity, this means that as you go down
the document each section builds upon and inherits sensibly from the previous
ones. This results in less undoing of styles, less specificity problems and
all-round better architected and lighter stylesheets.</p>
<p>The file and directory structure contained in this folder looks something like
this:</p>
<h3 id="top-level-files">Top level files</h3>
<p>These files are the main entry points for the Sass compiler and shouldn&#39;t
directly contain any CSS code, instead they only serves to combine the Sass
contained in the partials (see below) through @import directives.</p>
<h4 id="olender-styles-scss">olender.styles.scss</h4>
<p>This file aggregates all the components into a single file.</p>
<h4 id="olender-normalize-scss">olender.normalize.scss</h4>
<p>This file provides a CSS reset/normalize generated based on the legacy
variables.</p>
<h4 id="olender-hacks-scss">olender.hacks.scss</h4>
<p>This file may be used to provide temporary hot-fixes for style issues that
you plan to properly implement as components at a later point in time or simply
don&#39;t have a proper solution for yet.</p>
<h4 id="olender-no-query-scss">olender.no-query.scss</h4>
<p>This file re-renders the same contents as the styles.scss file but without any
media queries. It can be used as a fallback for for older browsers that don&#39;t
support media queries. You can find more information about this on the
github repository of the
