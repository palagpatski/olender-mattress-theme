<h1 id="overriding-theme-function">Overriding theme function</h1>
<p>Instead of defining theme function overrides in your template.php file Omega allows you to split them up into separate include files. These follow the same naming pattern as (pre-)process include files and are automatically lazy-loaded whenever the theme hook is invoked.</p>
<p>This feature greatly improves the maintainability of large themes that would otherwise contain hundreds of lines of unrelated code in your template.php file.</p>
<p>The include files have to follow a certain naming pattern (HOOK.theme.inc) for them to be automatically discovered:</p>
<ul>
<li>THEMENAME_breadcrumb() = breadcrumb.theme.inc</li>
<li>THEMENAME_button() = button.theme.inc</li>
</ul>
<p>As with template files, you should replace underscores from the hook names with hyphens:</p>
<ul>
<li>THEMENAME_status_messages() = status-messages.theme.inc</li>
<li>THEMENAME_menu_link() = menu-link.theme.inc</li>
</ul>
<p>Inside of each of these files you define the theme function override just as you would otherwise do in your template.php file:</p>
<pre><code>function THEMENAME_HOOK(&amp;$variables) {
  // Your code here.
}
</code></pre><p>Example:</p>
<pre><code>function THEMENAME_menu_link(&amp;$variables) {
  // Your code here.
}
</code></pre><p>You can also provide theme function include files for theme hook suggestions.</p>
